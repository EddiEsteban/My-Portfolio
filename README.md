My online portfolio. It has three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact. Each page has a navbar that links to the rest of the pages.

The home has a short bio as well as a picture of myself. The portfolio page requests my github repo information, and returns a section for each with a link.

Contact has three forms and a submission button. This page is presumed to be further developed as I learn more about web development.
