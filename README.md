# My Portfolio

My online portfolio. Visitors can navigate between three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact. 

The home has a short bio as well as a picture of myself. The portfolio page requests my github repo information, and returns a section for each with two links: one for the deployed app, and one for the repo itself. Contact page lists the avenues through which I can be contacted.
